Should there be a whole separate document-level pipeline?
	Seems like the regular pipeline is geared toward pages
	Could be run after the regular pipeline, which is when we think some of the doclevel processes (ie. multipage tables) should be run

Regardless, doclevel processes should be run by some kind of DocumentParsingService
	And if that's happening, maybe there should be a MultiDocParsingService to handle paralellization and any other cross-document things we want to do

Seems like the acroform pipeline object should be a dataflow with a single data point

DoctectionPipe.analyze
	calls self.get_doc_entities_from_dataflow
		calls self.get_pdf_stream
		puts result in 
			service?
			method?
	or should it just create another pipeline
